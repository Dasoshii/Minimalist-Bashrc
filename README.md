# Minimalist Bashrc
A bashrc project looking for simplicity and usefulness. It main goal isn't to make a full custom for your bash appereance, but to make it easier and clean to edit.
Also it has some features that I hope I'll go developing better.
It has been designed in/for Arch Linux (I mean the functions section), but you can edit it and make it match with your favorite distro.

Functions added:
- Recursive cleaner for Pacman and Yay (removing orphans and their configuration files, also cleans cache of both)
- System updater for Pacman and yay by typing 'sysup' on terminal.
- File descompressor for different types of file (zip, rar, Z, tgz, tbz2, gz, bz2, tar, tar.gz, tar.bz2), so you just need one command.

Features:
- Change prompt appeareance for special dates and send notification (needs notify-send).
- Anime waifu random generator by typing 'waifu' on terminal (needs python3).

I'll be glad to hear about your ideas!

[PENDING CHANGES]
- Alias shorcuts for '2>/dev/null' and '2>/dev/null 2>&1 &' expressions.
